This shows all the groups that a user is a part of. Within an organization, a user can be in zero, one or more groups so the groups that the user is in should be divided per organization. Create a table for each organization that the user is in and within each table shows the group that the user is in within that organization.

<b> This shouldn't be here. </b> Having both projects and groups doesn't really make sense. We only need groups so that we can assign more than one person to a task on a project.
